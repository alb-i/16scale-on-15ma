# 16scale-on-15ma

* `scales.py` is a script that generates 16-notes per two-octaves scales with certain properties.
* `format_printable.py` formats the output such that it can be printed typewriter
style.

Currently, I'm looking for the right pitch of the individual scale notes
`JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY` such that each mode is easily represented by these pitches
and `#` and `b`'s.
